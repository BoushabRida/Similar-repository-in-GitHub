# Similar-repository-in-GitHub
n our days, many developers has at least once, used a social coding platform, such as GitHub [3]. These platforms allow developers to experience new ways of broadcast their activities and/or listen to activities of others; Since users are always searching the collaborators for theirs projects or the projects to collaborate, itâ€™s important to model repositories and analyse the similarities between them in order to recommend a right developer to a right project. Such studies are important as they help to improve the collaborative work by recommending developers with common background and interest. By analyzing the projects similarity and users interest we can build a recommendation system and make a link prediction between users.
